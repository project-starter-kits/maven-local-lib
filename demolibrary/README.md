# Demo Library Source

This is the demo library source which is used in the main project.  This project is used to build the library JAR file and to copy it to the lib folder of main project folder.

This project is used as a test library which will be considered as not available in the maven central repository and hence will be kept in the project lib folder assuming that lib folder is the local maven repository for the project for all private libraries which are not available in maven repository.
