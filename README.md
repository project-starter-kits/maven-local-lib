# Maven Project with local library JAR

Starter kit with a maven project POM with one library (JAR) included as a local dependency, committed with the project.

There may be some libraries which are legacy libraries or which are not available in maven central which can be included in maven projects by copying them to a local lib folder to keep them with the source code.

Copying binary JAR files in project is not recommended and this shall be used as a last option for including the dependencies in the project.

## Stack Included

* Java 9
* Junit 5
